                    <i>"01101000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111"</i> – it means “hello” in binary code. <br> 
                    I’m Andrei and I'm a software engineer, more ore less; a dude who is passionate about CS/CE (Computer Science/Computer Engineering). <br>
                    My fields of interests consist of software application, programming languages and operating systems.
                    I have experience with <b>C/C++</b>, Python, <b>Java</b>, SQL, C# and many more (...). <br>
                    Considering the fact that a trained Software Engineer must also be aware of the hardware structures, I must say that I am on the right path in becoming the successful person I have always wanted to be.
